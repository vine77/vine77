GPT-4 calls Nathan a "a multifaceted talent in music and technology, boasting over two decades of experience as a musician, producer, and software engineer, specializing in the innovative application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) to the development of cutting-edge musical instruments, human-computer interfaces, and songwriting and production techniques." üòÜ

The Cornell Electroacoustic Music Center (CEMC) [says](http://digital.music.cornell.edu/center-research/):

> Beyond new creative music work, CEMC also supports research. Center research has already won awards and garnered interest from beyond Cornell. In 2008, student Nathan Ward‚Äôs CUMotive (Wearable Interfaces for Cyberphysical Musical Expression) won the ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the BOOM‚Äù [faculty] award as well as an invitation to give a paper at the prestigious 2008 NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) conference. Ward is a long-time contributor to CEMC and performed along with other CEMC composers and technologists at the first musical performance of any kind at Google (Administrative headquarters in New York, 2006 and again in 2007). The Google event set off a Cornell/Google collaborative effort to build an audio search mechanism, Search by Humming, developed at CEMC with Professor Graeme Bailey in Computer Information Science.
